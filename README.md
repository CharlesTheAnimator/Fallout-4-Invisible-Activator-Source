# Fallout-4-Invisible-Activator-Source
Language: Papyrus

The Intent is to make the activator as modular as possible

It can be set to check the player character for a ActorValue, or ItemID
When the player passes the required conditions the Activator will trigger when the player mouses over it and press the 'e' key(or activtor button from gamefile depending on player control config)
otherwise if the player does not meet conditions, it provides guidance to player as to what they need to aquire to meet the needed condition(s)
